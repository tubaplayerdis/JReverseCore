NOTE: If the Bridge DLL is Updated, it has to be copied to the jreverse folder(more like replaces) for updates to work becuase it uses that dll: C:\Users\aaron\IdeaProjects\jreverse

IDEAS:
Add scripting impl with java as the language and auto link to loaded binaries, but also so people can script and execute whatever with it. This would require a way to accses the classes already present from java
(DO THIS FIRST)Also implement python as a beginner version of the scripter, allowing functions to be called with intergal types and responses.(DO THIS FIRST)
Scripting Documentation can be in c# using JCOBridge
