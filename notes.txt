NOTE: If the Bridge DLL is Updated, it has to be copied to the jreverse folder(more like replaces) for updates to work becuase it uses that dll: C:\Users\aaron\IdeaProjects\jreverse

IDEAS:
Add ability to load class files and jar files into the injected jvm via the UI. This is already implemented just need to link it with the UI
add method to jython embed to allow the return of instanced java classes
Scripting Documentation can be in plain html

TODO:
