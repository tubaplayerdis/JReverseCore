1. If the Bridge DLL is Updated, it has to be copied to the jreverse folder(more like replaces) for updates to work becuase it uses that dll: C:\Users\aaron\IdeaProjects\jreverse

2. The sharedMemManager is for the bridge DLL, the PipeManager is for the injectable. They both deal with the same Shared Memory exepct that Pipe Manager uses open_only flag when iniating

3. Develop fully module pipe system. Create Pipes, Delete Pipes etc

4. look at search history and chat gpt for questions
